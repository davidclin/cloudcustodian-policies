      Cloud Custodian EBS Garbage Collection
    comments: |
      Delete unattached EBS volumes older than 1 day (24hrs) that 
      have the tag AutoCleanup set to true.
      Volumes set to not delete on instance termination do have
      valid use cases as data drives, but 99% of the time they
      appear to be just garbage creation.
      Use this policy at your discretion.
