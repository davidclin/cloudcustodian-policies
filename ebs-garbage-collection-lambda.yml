      Delete any unattached EBS volumes.
      Volumes set to not delete on instance termination do have
      valid use cases as data drives, but 99% of the time they
      appear to be just garbage creation.
      To run across all regions -> custodian run --dryrun -s out --region all ebs-garbage-collection.yml
      Use this policy at your discretion.
